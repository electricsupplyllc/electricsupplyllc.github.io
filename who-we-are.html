                <p>Stephen Breland began working in the electrical construction industry over 33 years ago, before being promoted to a purchasing agent position after 6 years of dedicated service. He was passionate about his work within the field, and in 1994 he was offered an inside sales position with one of the electrical distributors he worked with.

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>After 25 years in various managerial and sales positions, Mr. Breland began to dream of owning his own distributorship. That dream is now a reality!
